Asylum applicants find themselves in a precarious position â€” after they have fled from another precarious position. In Germany, they are often isolated and lack opportunities to participate in society. They are often subjected to numerous rules and sanctions in their housing, and on top of this, they are expected to understand complicated asylum procedures and manage bureaucratic hurdles, which are difficult even for people with proficiency in German.

With an Internet connection, people can not only keep in touch with their relatives and friends, but also communicate with the public, which often talks about refugees without talking with them. Refugees can also access information about their home countries, local laws, their rights, and translation aids.

Internet access, which many of us take for granted, is a privilege. This is unfortunate, and we believe that it should be a human right, and that it should be the State's responsibility to guarantee it. Even for refugees.
