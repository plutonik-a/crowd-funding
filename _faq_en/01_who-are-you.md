title: Who are we?
---
We are a group of people from different organisations -- such as the [Förderverein freie Netzwerke](http://foerderverein.freie-netzwerke.de/), [Chaos Computer Club e.V.](http://ccc.de/), [Freifunk Berlin](http://berlin.freifunk.net/) -- and friends, that want to support [Refugees Emancipation (RE)](http://refugeesemancipation.com/).

For almost 15 years, RE has been engaged in giving refugee camps internet cafés. Beyond that, a curriculum has been developed to teach a working knowledge of computer usage.

We help RE with collecting resources to extend their project. In the first phase we campaign for donations to cover running costs. In addition to that, we coordinate hardware contributions and workshop offerings.
