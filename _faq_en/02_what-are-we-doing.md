title: What are we doing?
---
We support Refugees Emancipation with organising a donation compaign, so they can work better -- and for a long time -- at their important project.

We help RE to continue being active and effective. That's why we want to equip them with necessary resources to extend their work and scope of action, to develop the project further -- also with regards to content.
