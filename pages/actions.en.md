### You could...
- collect donations for the project at your own event
- initiate a solidarity night at your favourite pub, simply with a donation box on the bar   
- put on a solidarity party and donate the entry fees
- host a classic bake sale
- arrange an auction or a flea market
- organise a charity concert

... or have another idea :)

Please tell us about your action at  [support@refugeesemancipation.com](mailto:support@refugeesemancipation.com), specifying date, headline and short description and we will publish the action on this website and help promoting it.

## What, when, and where?

<p class="subheadline subheader">October 10, 2015 Astra Stube Neukölln - Berlin</p>

<h3 class="t0">Solidarity party: "Fleeing is not a crime"</h3>

A solidarity counter was established at Astra Stube Neukölln: Football memorabilia and, among other things, advertising posters (bus stop format), a jersey from Hansa from unknown origin and a homemade flag from the club St. Pauli were sold by auction. The highlight was a private living-room concert with Thees Uhlmann, singer of the band Tomte. <br> [twitter.com/theesuhlmann](https://twitter.com/theesuhlmann).
